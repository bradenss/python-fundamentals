# Lesson 7 Looping Statements
# while loop
# Executes a set of statement until its condition is false
def basic_while(arg):
    alpha = arg
    while alpha < 4:
        print(alpha)
        # increment by 1
        alpha += 1


# basic_while(0)

# for loop
# Executes a set of statements sas ir iterates a collection or sequence
def basic_for(arg):
    for alpha in arg:
        print(alpha)


# basic_for('I like coding')

# nested for loop
# You can have a loop inside a loop. The inner loop can use the
# variable of the outer loop. Both must have different declared variables.
def basic_nested():
    for hop in range(1, 11):
        for bop in range(hop):
            print(hop, end=' ')
        print()
    print()

# range()
# This is used to return a sequence of numbers. This includes a start
# number, end number and increment.
# single argument
def basic_single():
    for able in range(5):
        print(able)


# two arguments
def basic_double():
    for beta in range(2, 10):
        print(beta)


# basic_single()
# basic_double()
# three arguments
def basic_three():
    for charlie in range(0, 15, 2):
        print(charlie)


# basic_three()

# pass statement
# This allows a for loop to be created without a body
for num in 'hello':
    pass


# break statement
# This is used in conjunction with an if statement to break from a loop
def basic_break(num1):
    while num1 < 10:
        print(num1)
        if num1 == 5:
            break

# using a for loop
def basic_break_for():
    for value in 'Python':
        if value == 'h':
            break

# continue statement
# This statement will stop an active iteration and begin the next one.
def basic_continue():
    for value in 'Python':
        if value == 'h':
            continue

# else statement
# Also used in loops, this statement can be used after te loop ends
def basic_else():
    thing1 = 0

        print(thing1)
        thing1 += 1
